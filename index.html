				  <p>The scatter plot above illustrates the relationship between state poverty rates and people's lack of healthcare.
					  As we can see, there is a moderate correlation (0.525) in this data -- suggesting that state poverty
					  rates have an influential role in a citizens' ability to obtain health insurance. Because of this, the US should
					  consider cheaper healthcare alternatives in areas of high poverty rates. </p>
